# JourneyAI – Decode Emotions, Map Experiences

> Helping teams turn emotional friction into product clarity.

---

### Why JourneyAI?

Modern product journeys are broken.

Users don’t just click. They feel.  
They hesitate, get overwhelmed, abandon sign-ups, or churn silently.  
Yet most analytics tools treat these emotional signals as noise.

**JourneyAI** was created to fix this.

We built a smart visual tool that helps teams:
- Map the user journey from Awareness to Conversion
- Identify emotional friction points
- Understand hidden patterns through emotion-tagged insights

---

### What’s the Essence?

JourneyAI isn’t just a static journey map — it’s **emotion-aware**.  
It surfaces friction triggers like:
- 😕 Confusing onboarding
- 😠 Frustrating pricing models
- 😐 Feature overload

It empowers product managers, UX researchers, and growth teams to **design with empathy**.
